Last few months I've been playing around with some great new technlogies in the
sphere of the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) and React.

I've always been fascinated by blazing fast websites, static websites and recently
got a lot of interest in React. I've been using it at work and was never happier
creating front-end applications. When I first found out about Gatsby I couldn't
believe it was possible to combine in one static websites (well ok static assets)
and React.

I remember being in a train and testing this awesome tool and being able to just
create fast a website with markdown and have all these performance optimisations,
image effects out of the box and being amazed by it! Few months later and here I
am having contributed numerous PRs into this awesome project with its vibrant,
inclusive and helpful community.

I've also published my first NPM packages:

* [gatsby-source-instagram](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-source-instagram)
* [gatsby-source-dropbox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-source-dropbox)
* [gatsby-remark-rehype-images](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-remark-rehype-images)
* [gatsby-source-marvel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-source-marvel)

I was so excited with how easy things were I've put up in a few days a travel blog
[OAsome](https://oasome.blog/) using Gatsby. And this is what got me into thinking
that maybe I should try another UI component library. After all I was reading everywhere about this awesome libaries for css-in-js (styled-components and emotion)
that I had to give it a try.

Tadaa! I have now found out about Grommet and its awesome team and have been
contributing numerous PRs to that project as well! For me Grommet feels like a new
fresh air in design and components!

I managed to combine both together for creating a [theme builder](https://grommet-theme-builder.netlify.com/) and I am all too excited about other
websites I can put up online.

Finally when I decided to give a small/big facelift to my personal website I couldn't go
with anything else besides Gatsby and Grommet! Fast, beautiful (to my taste) and
with the tools I like! Looking forward writing here about my adventures with those tools and my interaction with the awesome community!
