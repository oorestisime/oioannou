## 1 What’s changing

For years, Cyprus-resident owners of Ltds took a double hit: they already paid the 12.5 % corporate tax and a steep 17 % Special Defence Contribution (SDC) on every euro of dividends, while non-dom founders (and multinationals routing profits abroad) escaped the SDC entirely. The 2026 package kills two birds at once:

- OECD Pillar Two compliance. Bumping the corporate rate to 15 % keeps Cyprus off the low tax blacklist
- Fairness to local shareholders

The bulk of changes are summarized below:

<div class="md-table">

| Item                                            |    2025 law | Draft bill (earliest 1 Jan 2026) |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------: | -------------------------------: |
| **Corporate tax (CIT)**                         |  **12.5 %** |                         **15 %** |
| **Dividend SDC**                                |    **17 %** |                          **5 %** |
| **Dividend GHS**                                |      2.65 % |                      _unchanged_ |
| Personal-income tax, Social-Insurance, GHS, VAT | _unchanged_ |                   slight changes |

</div>

Personal income tax is getting also very small modifications like taking the 0% band from 19.5k to 20.5k and similar adjustments to higher bands. The outcome is not that significant so I ll omit this change for simplicity.

_Assumptions identical to the [first post](/blog/self-employed-vs-ltd-cyprus-2025/):_

- director salary €19 500, audit + book-keeping + levy = €2 350, same SI/GHS rates.

**Key insight →** the 5 % dividend tax more than offsets the extra 2.5 % CIT at virtually every profit level above ~€40 k.

## 3 Why the maths flips

1. **Dividends dominate** a one-person company’s cash-out (salary fixed at the tax-free band).
2. Cutting SDC from 17 % → 5 % shaves **12 percentage points** off every euro you distribute.
3. Raising CIT by 2.5 points only bites on the _residual_ profit **after** salary and running costs.

In the €100 k scenario, you trade **€3 748 more CIT** for **€10 001 less SDC** → net +€6 253.

## 4 Scenario deep dives

### At €60k

_Before reform_ net €42 485 → _After_ €45 423 (+ €2 938) – effective tax drops from **29.2 %** → **24.3 %**.

### At €100k

_Before_ €70 608 → _After_ €76 822 (+ €6 214) – effective tax **29.4 %** → **23.2 %**.

### At €150k

_Before_ €105 761 → _After_ €116 071 (+ €10 310) – effective tax **29.5 %** → **22.6 %**.

| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Defer large dividends until law passes**      | Existing Ltds with retained earnings | Save 12 % SDC immediately. Still no word if SDC change will change also for 2025 and prior dividents |
| **Incorporate in 2025 but take minimal salary** | High-margin freelancers > €80 k      | Lock in liability protection; enjoy 5 % SDC later.                                                   |
| **Stay solo for ≤ €40 k profit**                | Lower margin freelancers             | Still cheaper, zero audit admin.                                                                     |

## 6 FAQ

**“Is the 5 % rate guaranteed?”**

> Not until the House votes; current wording keeps 17 % if the paying company sits in a low-tax jurisdiction.

**“Do non-doms still pay 0 % SDC?”**

> Yes. Non-dom status trumps the new 5 % rate—you keep paying zero.

**“Will my accountant software auto-update?”**

> Most Cypriot payroll apps publish January rate patches; ask your vendor in December.
