## 1 Why compare right now?

Whether you sell mobile apps to international audience, build a SaaS for Limassol cafés, or bill a local agency by the hour, the Cyprus tax rules you face are identical. Your only structural choice is:

<div class="md-table">

| Legal path        | Best for …                                                                             |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Self-employed** | Side-gig or client list with profit **under ± €45 k**                                  |
| **Cyprus Ltd**    | Remote dev / solo SaaS who needs liability shield, dividends, or bigger-company optics |

</div>

When I moved back to Cyprus after many years I was facing the question of self-employment vs Ltd for being able to clear the money I was paid for working remotely at [Bold.org](https://bold.org). Hopefully this article clears the question for you!

> As of **May 2025** the law still says **12.5 % corporate tax** and **17 % dividend Special Defence Contribution (SDC)**. A draft bill to move those to **15 % and 5 % in 2026** is _not_ enacted yet, so every number below is the **current reality**. I am writing a follow-up article to see if those changes affect current math.

## 2 TL;DR — who keeps more cash?

<div class="md-table">

| Annual gross revenue | Net **self-employed** | Effective tax | Net **Ltd**<br>(salary €19 500 + dividends) | Effective tax | Winner            |

| **€60 000**          | €36 755               | 38.7 %        | **€42 485**                                 | 29.2 %        | **Ltd**           |

_Assumptions_

- Self-employed: no deductible expenses; Social Insurance (SI) on the 2025 cap (€66 612); GHS 4 %.
- Ltd: one employee (you) on **€19 500** salary → 0 % personal-income tax; employer SI + GHS 11.7 %, employee SI + GHS 11.45 %; audit €1 200, bookkeeping €800, Registrar levy €350.
- All figures **rounded**; your mileage will vary with real expenses.

## 3 Quick definitions

- **Self-employed** – you register on **SISnet**, pay SI directly, and file a personal T.D1 return.
- **Private Ltd** – a company limited by shares where you are sole director-shareholder; must file **audited accounts** every year.

## 4 Direct taxes in 2025

<div class="md-table">

## 7 Scenario walk-throughs

### A — €30 000

<div class="md-table">

|                   | Self-employed | Ltd                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Income tax        | € 2 200       | 0                                       |
| Social Insurance  | € 4 980       | € 2 282 (employer) + € 1 716 (employee) |
| GHS               | € 1 200       | € 585 (salary + dividend)               |
| Corporate tax     | –             | € 734                                   |
| Dividend SDC      | –             | € 873                                   |
| Running costs     | –             | € 2 350                                 |
| **Net take-home** | **€21 620**   | € 21 393                                |

</div>

**Result:** at this income level the **sole-trader wins** by a hair and saves the admin hassle.

### B — €60 000 full-time contractor

_Self-employed_: net **€36 755** (38.7 % effective)  
_Ltd_: net **€42 485** (29.2 % effective) ➜ **Ltd ahead × €5.7 k**

### C — €100 000 senior remote dev

_Self-employed_: net **€60 057** (40.0 %)  
_Ltd_: net **€70 608** (29.4 %) ➜ **Ltd ahead × €10.5 k**

### D — €150 000 solo SaaS

_Self-employed_: net **€90 557** (39.6 %)  
_Ltd_: net **€105 761** (29.5 %) ➜ **Ltd ahead × €15.2 k**

## 8 Decision flow-chart (text)

1. **Will your 2025 profit exceed ± €45 k?**  
   _No_ → self-employed keeps about the same at 45k but avoids admin hassle
   _Yes_ → go to 2.

2. **Do you need liability protection or “corporate” optics for clients / app stores?**  
   _Yes_ → incorporate now.  
   _No_ → if profit sits between €40 k–€80 k, run both scenarios with your real expenses; above €80 k a Ltd almost always wins.

## 9 DIY vs pay-for-help

<div class="md-table">

| Task                               | DIY?              | Typical fee        |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Register as self-employed          | ✅                | €0                 |
| Quarterly provisional-tax payments | ✅                | €150 / yr          |
| Keep double-entry books for Ltd    | ⚠️ time-sink      | €50–€100 / mo      |
| Prepare audited accounts           | ❌                | €1 000–€1 800 / yr |
| File VAT returns                   | ✅ (few invoices) | €300–€600 / yr     |

</div>

> **Rule of thumb:** a one-person Ltd’s compliance stack costs **€2.5 k–€3 k a year**; a sole trader can stay under **€500** if they do the paperwork themselves.

## 10 Checklists

### Registering as self-employed

1. Fill **Form YKA 01-008** at the District SI Office.
2. Activate **SISnet** → pick a notional-income band.
3. Get **TIN** at the Tax Department.
4. Register for **GHS** in Taxisnet.
5. Add **VAT** once turnover > €15 600.

### Incorporating a Ltd

1. Hire a lawyer for drafting the necessary papers and reserve name. Cost me 800€.
2. Open a business bank account (expect deep KYC).
3. Obtain **TIN** + **Taxisnet** logins.
4. Register as employer on **ERGANI**; run payroll.
5. Book an auditor for year-end. Hook up bookkeeping service or pay the auditor to also do bookkeping
6. Create a company stamp. Yes this is still used in 2025 regardless of the absurdity of how you create those.

## 11 FAQ

**“Can I pay only dividends and skip salary?”**  
No. The Tax Department expects a market-value salary; keeping one at **€19 500** keeps personal tax at 0 % but proves substance.

**“Do non-dom rules kill the 17 % SDC?”**  
Yes, but only if you are _not_ Cyprus-domiciled. This guide assumes you are.

**“Is the 15 % CIT / 5 % SDC reform certain?”**  
Not yet. The bill is still in committee. I’ll publish a follow-up discussing it.

### Bottom line for 2025

- **Profit < €45 k** → stay self-employed.
- **Profit €45 k – €80 k** → run your own spreadsheet; savings may not justify admin.
- **Profit > €80 k** → a one-person Ltd saves five-figure sums net, even before any 2026 reform.
