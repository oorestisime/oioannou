My latest job as a freelance Web developper was to create a website for a PhD student at the University at Buffalo in  United States. His research interests include transportation systems, robust optimization and applications of Operations Research in healthcare.

I worked 1 week to get to the actual result. The main tools i used were:

- PHP, for database connection where he stores his publications, articles etc.
- Foundation as a CSS framework
- FontAwesome for the icons 
- Filezilla as an FTP client
- Sublime Text as text editor

The result can be observed [here](http://toumiak.com). Iakovos has now an FTP access at my server to modify and insert new information as well as an interface where he adds new articles, publications etc in the database. 

> I am pretty happy with my website. Orestis created the interfacte i wanted and I am now able to modify, insert and delete the information I want at any time.
