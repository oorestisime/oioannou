Unfortunately i have many projects during this time of the year for the university. The main subjects are Object Oriented programmation in java, web programmation using servlets and jsp (*sigh*), a pascal compilator programmed using flex-bison-c++ and some small project on SPARQL and Prolog.

I don't think i will uploading anything on my github repo mainly because:

- the projects are based on specific demands of the professors, so nothing really general
- who would actually need a pascal compilator!
- i hate java, jsp, javascript, java.....

I might be uploading something for SPARQL as it is something new and efficient.
I hope that after January i ll be able to work on anything else, mainly an open source project.

Lastly i ll have a research project. I am still searching but my orientation is Cryptography, Software Security and possibly Database security.
