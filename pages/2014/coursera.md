Besides the university things [reference](../university/) the next few months I will be participating at three Coursera courses.

In case you do not know about [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
> Coursera is an education platform that partners with top universities and organizations worldwide, to offer courses online for anyone to take, for free.
> We envision a future where everyone has access to a world-class education. We aim to empower people with education that will improve their lives, the lives of their families, and the communities they live in.

The courses I will be taking are:

+ Software Security | University of Maryland, College Park
+ Cryptography | University of Maryland, College Park
+ Cryptography 2 | Stanford University

I have already participated at the first cryptography course by Stanford which was extremely usefull. I'll try to post an overview for the courses i ll take in the next few months and keep up to date with the assignements etc.
